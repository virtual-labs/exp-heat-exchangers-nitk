## INTRODUCTION<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:
<br>
1. To determine the Log mean temperature difference.
<br>
2. To determine the  overall heat transfer coefficient for the inside area.
<br>
3. To determine the effectiveness of the heat exchanger.

#### Theory

A heat exchanger is a system used to transfer heat between two fluids, one hot and one cold as shown in Fig. 1.

Heat transfer from one fluid to another fluid is given by the expression,<br>

Where,<br>
	(∆T)<sub>m</sub> is the mean temperature difference
	U is the overall heat transfer coefficient for the inside area<br>
	A is the inside area of the heat exchanger<br>

This expression for the mean temperature difference is known as the Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD).

In order to make comparisons between various types of heat exchangers, the term Heat Exchanger Effectiveness is used, which is defined as:

Actual heat transfer may be computed by calculating the energy lost by the hot fluid or the energy gained by the cold fluid as Q = C<sub>h</sub> (T<sub>hi</sub>-T<sub>ho</sub> ) or Q= C<sub>c</sub> (T<sub>co</sub>-T<sub>ci</sub> ).

Both for parallel and counter flow heat exchanger where<br>
 C<sub>h</sub>= W<sub>h</sub> C<sub>ph</sub> and C<sub>c</sub>= W<sub>c</sub> C<sub>pc</sub>

W<sub>h</sub> = mass of hot fluid flowing per unit time<br>
W<sub>c</sub> = mass of cold fluid flowing per unit time<br>
C<sub>ph</sub> and C<sub>pc</sub> are the specific heats of the hot and cold fluid respectively<br>
Maximum possible heat transfer is given by <br>
Q<sub>max</sub>= C<sub>min</sub> (T<sub>hi</sub>-T<sub>ci</sub> )

Where C<sub>min</sub> is either C<sub>ph</sub> or C<sub>pc</sub>, whichever is lesser.
Hence, effectiveness
